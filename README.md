# [Understanding and Using OAuth in Laravel][published url]
## Instructor: [Simon Bacquie][instructor url]


Typical internet users connect to lots of different services and web applications. As we come to use more and more of these services, we expect them to integrate with each other for convenience and ease of use. Much of this integration is made possible through OAuth, a standard for authorizing integrations between applications securely and reliably.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Simon Bacquie will explain what OAuth is and why it is used, through visuals and examples. You'll see an actual OAuth integration happen between two web apps that were written specifically for this course. You'll also get to look at Simon's simple implmentation of OAuth in Laravel, step-by-step.


## Source Files Description

This repo contains a complete example of an OAuth integration in Laravel.

These apps were set up inside a Homestead instance. If you're using Homestead already, it should be easy to run MyBookshelf and Wormrate locally, side-by-side.

Each app uses a `sqlite3` database, which is included in its source code. You can open those files with any database tool that supports sqlite3. I'm using [DBeaver](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/) for that.

Postman presets are under the `postman` folder. You can download that file and import them as a collection into your own copy of Postman.
